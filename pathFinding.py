        1) Initialize the starting node and the end node.

        3) Initialize the closed list as empty.
        4) While the open list is not empty:
            A. Get the node with the lowest f-cost from the open list.
            B. Add the current node to the closed list.
            C. For each neighbor of the current node:
                I. If the neighbor is the end node, we have found the path. Return it.
                II. If the neighbor is not passable or is in the closed list, skip it.

                IV. If the neighbor is already in the open list, update its f-cost if the current path is better.

        h-cost (heuristic cost): An estimate of the distance from the current node to the goal node. This is usually
            calculated using a heuristic function, which may not be exact but should never overestimate the actual
            distance.
        g-cost (movement cost): The cost of moving from the starting node to the current node. This is typically
            calculated as the sum of the movement costs of all the nodes visited along the path from the starting node
            to the current node.
        f-cost (total cost): The sum of the g-cost and the h-cost for a particular node. This represents the estimated
            total cost of the cheapest path from the starting node to the goal node that goes through the current node.
            The algorithm selects the node with the lowest f-cost as the next node to explore.
